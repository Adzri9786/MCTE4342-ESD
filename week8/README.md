EEPROM stands for Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory. It is a type of non-volatile memory that can be used to store data that needs to be retained when the power is turned off.

In the context of programming, an EEPROM function is a function that allows a programmer to read from or write to the EEPROM memory on a device. The specific syntax and usage of the EEPROM function will depend on the programming language and the specific hardware platform being used.

For example, in the Arduino programming language, the EEPROM library provides functions for reading and writing data to the EEPROM memory on an Arduino board. The EEPROM.write() function is used to write a value to a specific location in the EEPROM memory, and the EEPROM.read() function is used to read a value from a specific location in the EEPROM memory.

It's worth noting that EEPROM memory has a limited number of write cycles, so it's important to use it carefully and minimize the number of writes to the memory if possible.

there are however things to note like how both the EEPROM.put() and EEPROM.write() functions are used to write values to the EEPROM memory but they differ in terms of the data types that they can write to the EEPROM memory.

The EEPROM.write() function can only write values of the byte, char, int and long data types to the EEPROM memory.

On the other hand, the EEPROM.put() function can write values of any data type to the EEPROM memory. This includes not only the data types supported by EEPROM.write(), but also data types such as float, double, and bool.

In this example,the Arduino remember the stored LED state, even when we reset the Arduino or the power goes off.

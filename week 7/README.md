when an interrupt button were pressed the red led will turn on as an indicator while yellow led will blink continuously. 

There are many potential uses for interrupts in an Arduino sketch. Here are a few examples:

Handling real-time events: Interrupts can be used to handle events that need to be handled immediately, such as a button press or a sensor reading that exceeds a certain threshold.

Improving the efficiency of a sketch: Interrupts can be used to perform certain tasks in the background while the main program continues to run, improving the overall efficiency of the sketch.

Responding to external signals: Interrupts can be used to respond to external signals, such as a signal from a GPS module or a wireless communication module.

Debouncing buttons and switches: Interrupts can be used to debounce buttons and switches, which can help to prevent false readings caused by electrical noise.

Implementing time-critical tasks: Interrupts can be used to implement time-critical tasks, such as generating a PWM signal with precise timing.

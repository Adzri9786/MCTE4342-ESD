Serial communication is a method of transmitting data between devices using a serial connection. Serial communication is commonly used to transfer data between microcontrollers and computers, or between two microcontrollers.

To use serial communication with an Arduino, you can use the Serial library. The Serial library provides functions for sending and receiving data over a serial connection.

arduino 1 code will turn the LED on or off based on the value of the data received from the serial port.

arduino 2 code will send the value of the button (either 1 or 0) over the serial port every 100 milliseconds.

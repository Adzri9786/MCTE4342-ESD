Stepper motor

A stepper motor is a type of electric motor that can rotate in small, precise increments, or "steps." Stepper motors are commonly used in robotics and automation applications because they can be controlled with high precision and accuracy.

To control a stepper motor with an Arduino, you will need a stepper motor driver (such as the A4988 or DRV8825) to convert the control signals from the Arduino into the high current and voltage signals required by the stepper motor. You will also need jumper wires to connect the stepper motor, the driver, and the Arduino.

as i do not have the required component at the moment i could only show an image of the circuit
